                            <p>Our facility was custom designed and built to meet the many differing wants and needs of cats and dogs.</p>

                            <p>No expense was spared to make sure our accommodations offer a variety of choices to make your cat or dogâ€™s stay with us as comfortable as possible.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Some of our luxury features include:</span></p>

                            <p><i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> Day lounges for dogs that require down time during the day away from the play.</p>

                            <p><i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> Separate senior dog wing that offers heated floors and accommodations in a quieter location in the building close to the watchful eye of reception staff.</p>

                            <p>In addition, we have implemented a number of "green" initiatives into our building to help keep everyone healthy, including the environment.</p>

                            <p><i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> A custom designed daylighting system - this system is electricity-free, operating instead by focusing natural sunlight through reflective tubing into the playground and pool and dispersing the light using a diffuser.</p>

                            <p><i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> Low voltage and LED lighting throughout.</p>

                            <p><i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> UV technology filters the pool so no harmful chemicals or salt is used that can dry out sensitive skin and coats.</p>

                            <p><i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> Woven K9 Grass around the pool is specifically made for dogs and features a flushing system under the raised grass that removes all waste and water from around the pool.</p>

                            <p><i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> Filtered watering system for dogs and cats.</p>
