                            <p>When we got home, Alice literally walked in the front door and collapsed from exhaustion. She was even out of it yesterday. I was wondering if I had come home with the same dog ... LOL. I told my husband that I will just have to send her to the Spa for a couple of days every time she gets too wound up.</p>

                            <p>I am very happy with Park 9. You can expect to see Alice again!!!!</p>
